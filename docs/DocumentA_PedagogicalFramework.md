📘 LINGUINS v6.1 — PRODUCT & LEARNING FRAMEWORK
Official Pedagogical Standard – STPME Architecture
Version A.1 – Corporate Edition (English)

0. Purpose of this Document
This document establishes the pedagogical, experiential, and conceptual foundation of Linguins v6.1.
 It defines how the system must behave, how learning must be structured, and how the user experience must feel at every stage.
It is intended for:
    Product & UX teams
    Engineering
    AI/ML development
    Codex / automated code assistants
    Designers
    Investors & stakeholders
This is not a technical document.
 It is the north star that all technical and creative decisions must follow.


1. Linguins Vision Statement
Linguins is not a flashcard app.
 Linguins is a modular, adaptive, emotionally intelligent learning system designed to help users learn languages in a way that feels effective, motivating, and deeply human.
Core product philosophy:
    The learner is always at the center.
    Every session must feel valuable.
    AI guides the process, but learning remains human-driven.
    The system adapts automatically to each person’s pace and needs.
    The platform evolves through independent, scalable modules.



2. STPME Framework — The Five Engines of Linguins
The pedagogical foundation of Linguins is built on five engines that work together to create a complete learning experience.

2.1 SKILL ENGINE
Internal measurement of real learning. (Invisible to the user)
It tracks:
    mastery of items (words, phrases, concepts)
    retention
    speed
    accuracy
    writing abilities
    pattern recognition
This engine determines what the user truly knows—not what they “completed.”


2.2 TRACKING ENGINE
External visibility of progress. (Visible to the user)
Transforms internal learning data into meaningful insights:
    weekly progress
    strengths & weaknesses
    accuracy evolution
    speed improvements
    consistency patterns

Tracking = clarity.
 Skill = reality.


2.3 ADAPTIVE ENGINE
The pedagogical director of the platform.
Responsible for:
    deciding what the user should study today
    balancing review vs. new content
    adjusting difficulty dynamically
    detecting frustration and stagnation
    recommending modes based on available time
    generating “soft re-entry sessions” after inactivity
This engine ensures personalized and frictionless progress.


2.4 MOTIVATION ENGINE
Drives healthy, adult motivation.
Provides:
    positive reinforcement
    recognition of effort
    micro-goals
    momentum-building messages
    non-childish gamification
Its goal is to foster constancy and psychological reward, without gimmicks.


2.5 EMOTIONAL ENGINE
Human-centered guidance and emotional support.
Responds to:
    frustration
    low energy
    fear of mistakes
    lack of confidence
    motivation dips

It generates empathetic, concise, emotionally intelligent messages such as:
    “This is a normal challenge at your level.”
    “Let’s keep today light; you’re doing well.”
    “Coming back is already a big step.”
Emotion supports.
 Motivation pushes.


3. Learning Atom – The Minimum Learning Unit
To build a flexible and scalable learning system:
✔ Item = universal minimum unit of study
An item can represent:
    a word
    a short phrase
    a chunk
    a simple concept (article, preposition, verb pattern)

This provides:
    total modularity
    consistent behavior across all modes
    future-proofing for advanced learning features
    compatibility with STPME engines
All study modes operate on Items.


4. Session Architecture (v6.1)
This defines the structure and components of every learning session.

4.1 Core Session Components
    a.Entry Assessment
        time availability detection
        user state analysis (returning, consistent, inactive)

    b.Warm-up (optional)
        1–2 easy items
        reduces stress, boosts confidence


    c.Adaptive Core
        real-time mixture of review + new items
        difficulty adjustments
        immediate micro-feedback
        error pattern detection

    d.Cooldown
        1 easy reinforcing item
        emotional support message

    e.Post-Session Insight
        accuracy summary
        strengths/weaknesses
        progress compared to previous sessions

    f.Next Step Recommendation
        suggested mode for tomorrow
        recommended focus areas
This architecture ensures learning feels efficient, supportive, and meaningful.


5. Emotional Design Principles (v6.1)
Linguins integrates emotional intelligence as a core product feature.

5.1 Tone & Personality
    Warm, concise, adult-friendly
    Non-judgmental
    Supportive and grounded
    Encouraging without infantilizing



5.2 Design Guidelines
    Celebrate effort, not perfection
    Normalize mistakes
    Encourage micro-habits
    Offer psychological safety
    Keep language short and empathetic
    Provide actionable, positive feedback


Examples:
    “Mistakes mean progress. Let’s review this together.”
    “You improved your response speed today.”
    “It’s okay to take it slow. You’re still moving forward.”



6. AI Integration Strategy
AI is used strategically, not excessively.
 The goal is support, not replacement of learning.

6.1 AI IS USED FOR:
    correcting writing (Feedback Mode)
    generating emotional support messages
    summarizing insights in natural language
    guiding micro-coaching interactions
future advanced personalization (v6.2)



6.2 AI IS NOT USED FOR:
    selecting new vocabulary items
    running SRS (this is database-driven for speed)
    correcting advanced grammar
    generating large amounts of content
    creating full lessons
AI exists to enhance clarity and human connection, not to overwhelm the user or slow the experience.

7. Ideal Session Flow (Smart Cycle)
This flow is the default for all study experiences in v6.1.
    Smart Entry
    Warm-up
    Adaptive Study Phase
    Micro-feedback loop
    Cooldown (confidence boost)
    Progress Insight
    Recommendation for next session
This ensures that every session feels personalized, human, and productive.

8. What Linguins v6.1 Does NOT Do
Critical for focus and alignment.
Linguins v6.1 does NOT include:
    free conversation with AI
    advanced grammar correction
    content generation (texts, dialogues)
    long-term study plans
    complex multimedia modes (Voice, Social, Explorer, Challenge)
    emotional detection beyond text
    AI-based vocabulary discovery
    pronunciation analysis
    advanced language production exercises
v6.1 is a focused, minimal, high-impact version.
